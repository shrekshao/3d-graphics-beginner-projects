Yes they are modern by the time they came out, but not anymore. OpenGL is an API first launched in 1992. Even its latest version 4.6 was released in 2017. Support for OpenGL on Mac is deprecated by Apple in 2018. The next-gen (well actually cur-gen) API like Vulkan and Metal came out around 2015.</p><p>And it is 2023 now...</p></div><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">non-GPU based lessons</p><p>Projects from university courses are often based on some GUI framework (Qt) and ask you to write CPU only code (i.e. no shaders). While one can argue that you can learn the algorithm by writing CPU code without using any GPU API, to me it feels like you want to learn computer programming in 2023 but chooses to start with Pascal. Just like that almost no software today you are familiar with is built by Pascal, no games/engines/design tool that you are familiar with is built without using GPU API.</p></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Modern features missing in WebGPU</p><p>Being a cross-platform and web graphics API that just come out, WebGPU isn&#39;t <em>that</em> modern. Features like native ray tracing API, mesh shader, multi-queue etc. are not available in WebGPU, yet. As a beginner you don&#39;t have to worry about these.</p></div></li><li><p>People prefer to learn in a project-driven way (like me, as I usually become absent minded during lectures)</p></li><li><p>People already know how to program, in <strong>any</strong> mainstream programming language.
