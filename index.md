# Modern 3D Graphics Beginner Projects in WebGPU

## Too long; didn't read

I want to know how modern games draw flashy 3D world on my screen. I want to learn 3D Graphics. I know how to program but that's it.

Then you are ready to go. Shut up and start learning and coding now! [Lesson 0 Intro](lessons/00-intro.md).

## More description about this "course"

This is:
  - A series of precanned projects for a 3D graphics new comer
    - Using WebGPU, a modern graphics API in web (as of 2023), backed by D3D12, Metal, Vulkan, etc.
  - providing essential knowledge to start Made by people with industry background

This is for:
  - People want to learn *real* modern and *industry* practical graphics knowledge.
    - Most graphics courses projects still uses OpenGL (even with prefix "Modern")
    ::: tip
    OpenGL is an API first launched in 1992. Even its latest version 4.6 was released in 2017.
    Support for OpenGL is deprecated by Apple in 2018. The next-gen (cur-gen) API like Vulkan and Metal came out around 2015.

    And it is 2023 now...
    :::
    or framework for software rendering (Yes it's educational based and you can learn the algorithm behind, but it's like you want to learn computer programming in 2023 but chooses to start with Pascal. I don't know any company used Pascal to build their app today).
  - People prefer to learn in a project-driven way (like me, as I usually become absent minded during lectures)
  - People know how to program, in any mainstream language. (C/C++, Java, C#, Python, Javascript, Typescript etc.) And that's the only prerequisite needed.
  - People want to feel ease move on to real-world scenarios after this course.

This is not:
  - A thorough tutorial for a specific Graphics API: WebGPU in our case ([webgpufundamentals.org](https://webgpufundamentals.org/))
  - A traditional univeristy style lecture-based course covering a more complete set of apsects of computer graphics, usually from professors with research background ([UCSB GAMES 101](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/teaching/games101.html))
  - A set of step-by-step tutorials to build ready-to-use 3D apps ([Three.js](https://threejs.org/), [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/), [Unity](https://unity.com/), etc.)
